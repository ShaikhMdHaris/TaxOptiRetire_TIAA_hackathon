2. *AI Tax Engine:*
   - Implements an AI algorithm that analyzes user data to identify potential tax optimization opportunities.
   - Considers factors such as eligibility for tax credits and deductions, retirement account withdrawal strategies, optimization of contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, and more.
   - Provides real-time recommendations based on the analysis, suggesting tax-saving actions retirees can take to optimize their tax strategies.
